# Yelp Data Analysis

Understanding business before establishing them is important. There are so many reasons why restaurants are not being successfull and few of them are not being on online, wait time of orders are too long, not having specific work areas etc.. 
Yelp data does an amazing job in collecting business data so that data scientist can analyze them and provide certain facts. 
This project of mine primarily focuses on storing huge data sets in MongoDb and analyzing them in Python using Apache Spark sql and Python pandas.
